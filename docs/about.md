XACC is a programming framework for extreme-scale accelerator architectures 
that integrates alongside existing conventional classical applications. It 
is a pluggable framework for programming languages and accelerators developed 
for next-gen computing hardware architectures like quantum and neuromorphic 
computing. It lets computational scientists efficiently off-load classically 
intractable work to attached accelerators through a user-friendly kernel API. 
XACC makes post-exascale hybrid programming approachable for domain computational scientists.
