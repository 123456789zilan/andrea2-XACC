\subsection{Detailed Description}
\subsubsection*{template$<$typename Signature$>$\\*
struct boost\+::dll\+::detail\+::constructor$<$ Signature $>$}

This class stores a constructor.

In some compilers there are several constructors in code, which may include an allocating one. This can be used if the imported class shall be put on the heap, which is why the class provied both types. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
ctor\+\_\+dtor.\+hpp\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
