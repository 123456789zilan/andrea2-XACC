Fire uses Jekyll for publishing documentation on Git\+Hub Pages and it uses the \href{http://hemangsk.github.io/Gravity/}{\tt Gravity theme}. There are several important things to keep in mind for this configuration. The Gemfile should contain


\begin{DoxyCode}
source 'https://rubygems.org'

# Ascii Doctor and PlantUML
gem 'jekyll', '~> 2.5'
gem 'asciidoctor', '~> 1.5'
gem 'coderay', '1.1.0'
gem 'rake-jekyll', '~> 1.0'
gem 'jekyll-plantuml', '~> 1.1' 

group :jekyll\_plugins do
  gem "jekyll-asciidoc"
  gem 'asciidoctor-diagram' 
end
\end{DoxyCode}


I ran into two major problems with Git\+Hub that took hours to fix and then only after contacting Git\+Hub directly.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The site.\+url (or just \char`\"{}url\char`\"{}) and site.\+baseurl variables in \+\_\+config.\+yml must be set to \char`\"{}http\+://\mbox{[}username\mbox{]}.\+github.\+io/\mbox{[}project\mbox{]}\char`\"{} for a project level deployment as in
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}
url = "http://jayjaybillings.github.io"
baseurl = "/fire"
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The only valid places to put github.\+io files are in the master branch, master/docs or in gh-\/pages. I used gh-\/pages/doc and it would not work until I merged into master/docs.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The Gravity theme works as expected when deployed using


\begin{DoxyCode}
bundle exec jekyll serve
\end{DoxyCode}


but deployment to Git\+Hub fails because the style.\+scss file has references to empty scss files in \+\_\+ssas directory starting at line 47. When these imports are removed or commented out, Git\+Hub will build the site.
