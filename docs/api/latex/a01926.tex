Simulations of thermonuclear networks in astrophysics require lists of reactions that describe how the species evolve over time. Fire supports a legacy A\+S\+C\+II format with a 8-\/line specification for a reaction. Each entry in each line is separated by a space. See \hyperlink{a00290_source}{Reaction.\+h} for full details on each required value.

The first line for each reaction contains\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Name/\+Label -\/ A string of the form \char`\"{}he4+he4+he4-\/-\/$>$c12\char`\"{} that describes the reaction.
\item Reaction Group Class -\/ an integer
\item Reaction Group Index -\/ an integer
\item R\+E\+A\+C\+L\+IB Class -\/ an integer
\item Number of reacting species -\/ an integer
\item Number of resulting products -\/ an integer
\item Electron capture flag -\/ a bool
\item Reverse reaction flag -\/ a bool
\item Statistical factor -\/ a double
\item Energy release -\/ a double
\end{DoxyItemize}

The second line contains the seven rate coefficients from the R\+E\+A\+C\+L\+IB library, all doubles. The third line contains the array of atomic numbers for the reactants in this reaction, which are integers. The fourth, fifth, and sixth lines are also integers for the reactant neutron number and product atomic and neutron numbers. Each of these four lines has one integer for each reactant and product in the system, but with no more than four entries per line. (See example below for more details.)

The seventh and eighth lines contain quantities that are used for {\itshape Partial Equilibrium} approximations. Each line contains up to three integers.
